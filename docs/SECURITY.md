# Security

Nerve is designed as a **local-first** web UI for an AI agent. Its security model assumes the server runs on a trusted machine and is accessed by its owner. It is **not** designed for multi-tenant or public-internet deployment without an additional reverse proxy and authentication layer.

## Threat Model

### In Scope

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| **Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)** | CORS allowlist restricts cross-origin requests. Only explicitly configured origins are allowed. |
| **Cross-site scripting (XSS)** | CSP `script-src 'self'` blocks inline/injected scripts (exception: `s3.tradingview.com` for chart widgets). HTML content is sanitised with DOMPurify on the client. |
| **Clickjacking** | `X-Frame-Options: DENY` and CSP `frame-ancestors 'none'` prevent embedding in iframes. |
| **Network sniffing** | Optional HTTPS with HSTS (`max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`). |
| **Abuse / resource exhaustion** | Per-IP rate limiting on all API endpoints. Global body size limits. Rate limit store capped at 10,000 entries. |
| **Directory traversal** | Resolved absolute paths checked against strict prefix allowlists. Symlinks resolved and re-checked. |
| **Symlink escape** | `/api/files` resolves symlinks via `fs.realpathSync()` and re-validates the real path against allowed prefixes. |
| **Gateway token exfiltration** | Token only returned via `/api/connect-defaults` to loopback clients. Remote clients receive `null`. |
| **Spoofed client IPs** | Rate limiter uses the real TCP socket address. `X-Forwarded-For` only trusted from configured `TRUSTED_PROXIES`. |
| **MIME sniffing** | `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` on all responses. |
| **CSP directive injection** | `CSP_CONNECT_EXTRA` is sanitised: semicolons and newlines stripped, only `http(s)://` and `ws(s)://` schemes accepted. |
| **Malformed CORS origins** | `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` entries are normalised via `new URL()`. Malformed entries and `"null"` origins are silently rejected. |

### Out of Scope

- **Multi-user authentication** — Nerve has no user accounts or login system. Access is controlled at the network level (localhost binding, firewall, VPN).
- **End-to-end encryption** — TLS covers transport; at-rest encryption of memory files or session data is not provided.
- **DDoS protection** — The in-memory rate limiter handles casual abuse but is not designed for sustained attacks. Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Cloudflare) for production exposure.

---

## Authentication & Access Control

Nerve does **not** implement its own auth layer. Security is enforced through:

1. **Localhost binding** — The server binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. Only local processes can connect.
2. **CORS allowlist** — Browsers enforce the Origin check. Only configured origins receive CORS headers.
3. **Gateway token isolation** — The sensitive `GATEWAY_TOKEN` is only exposed to loopback clients via `/api/connect-defaults`.
4. **Session storage** — The frontend stores the gateway token in `sessionStorage` (cleared when the tab closes), not `localStorage`.

When exposing Nerve to a network (`HOST=0.0.0.0`), consider:
- Using a VPN (Tailscale, WireGuard) — the setup wizard has first-class Tailscale support
- Placing Nerve behind a reverse proxy with authentication (nginx + basic auth, OAuth proxy, etc.)
- Restricting access with firewall rules

---

## CORS Policy

CORS is enforced on all requests via Hono's CORS middleware.

**Default allowed origins** (auto-configured):
- `http://localhost:{PORT}`
- `https://localhost:{SSL_PORT}`
- `http://127.0.0.1:{PORT}`
- `https://127.0.0.1:{SSL_PORT}`

**Additional origins** via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var (comma-separated). Each entry is normalised through the `URL` constructor:

```env
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://100.64.0.5:3080,https://my-server.tailnet.ts.net:3443
```

**Allowed methods:** `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `OPTIONS`  
**Allowed headers:** `Content-Type`, `Authorization`  
**Credentials:** Enabled (`credentials: true`)

Requests with no `Origin` header (same-origin, non-browser) are allowed through.

---

## Security Headers

Applied to **every response** via the `securityHeaders` middleware:

| Header | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `Content-Security-Policy` | See below | Defense-in-depth against XSS |
| `X-Frame-Options` | `DENY` | Prevent clickjacking |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` | Prevent MIME type sniffing |
| `X-XSS-Protection` | `1; mode=block` | Legacy XSS filter for older browsers |
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` | Enforce HTTPS for 1 year |
| `Referrer-Policy` | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` | Control referrer leakage |
| `Cache-Control` | `no-store` | Default for all responses (overridden by cache middleware for assets) |

### Content Security Policy

> **Implementation note:** CSP directives are built lazily on first request (not at module import time) to avoid race conditions with `dotenv/config` load order. The computed directives are then cached for the lifetime of the process.

```
default-src 'self';
script-src 'self' https://s3.tradingview.com;
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
connect-src 'self' ws://localhost:* wss://localhost:* http://localhost:* https://localhost:*
            ws://127.0.0.1:* wss://127.0.0.1:* http://127.0.0.1:* https://127.0.0.1:*
            [CSP_CONNECT_EXTRA];
img-src 'self' data: blob:;
media-src 'self' blob:;
frame-src https://s3.tradingview.com https://www.tradingview.com
          https://www.tradingview-widget.com https://s.tradingview.com;
frame-ancestors 'none';
base-uri 'self';
form-action 'self'
```

**TradingView domains:** The `script-src` and `frame-src` entries for TradingView are required for the inline `tv` chart type, which uses TradingView's official widget embed script. The script injects iframes from multiple TradingView subdomains.

The `connect-src` directive can be extended via `CSP_CONNECT_EXTRA` (space-separated). Input is sanitised:
- Semicolons (`;`) and newlines (`\r`, `\n`) are stripped to prevent directive injection
- Only entries matching `http://`, `https://`, `ws://`, or `wss://` schemes are accepted

---

## Rate Limiting

In-memory sliding window rate limiter applied to all `/api/*` routes.

### Presets

| Preset | Limit | Window | Applied To |
|--------|-------|--------|------------|
| TTS | 10 requests | 60 seconds | `POST /api/tts` |
| Transcribe | 30 requests | 60 seconds | `POST /api/transcribe` |
| General | 60 requests | 60 seconds | All other `/api/*` routes |

### Implementation Details

- **Per-client, per-path** — Each unique `clientIP:path` combination gets its own sliding window.
- **Client identification** — Uses the real TCP socket address from `getConnInfo()`. **Not** spoofable via request headers.
- **Trusted proxies** — `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Real-IP` are only honoured when the direct connection comes from an IP in `TRUSTED_PROXIES` (default: loopback addresses only). Extend via `TRUSTED_PROXIES` env var.
- **Store cap** — The rate limit store is capped at **10,000 entries** to prevent memory amplification from spoofed IPs (when behind a trusted proxy). When full, the oldest entry is evicted.
- **Cleanup** — Expired timestamps are purged every 5 minutes.

### Response Headers

Every response includes:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 57
```

When rate-limited (HTTP 429):

```
Retry-After: 42
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1708100060
```

## Input Validation

All POST/PUT endpoints validate request bodies with [Zod](https://zod.dev/) schemas:

| Endpoint | Validated Fields |
|----------|-----------------|
| `POST /api/tts` | `text` (1–5000 chars, non-empty), `provider` (enum), `voice`, `model` |
| `PUT /api/tts/config` | Strict key allowlist per section, string values only, max 2000 chars |
| `POST /api/transcribe` | File presence, size (≤12 MB), MIME type allowlist |
| `POST /api/agentlog` | Optional typed fields (`ts`, `type`, `message`, `level`, `data`) |
| `POST /api/memories` | `text` (1–10000 chars), `section` (≤200), `category` (enum), `importance` (0–1) |
| `PUT /api/memories/section` | `title` (1–200), `content` (≤50000), `date` (YYYY-MM-DD regex) |
| `DELETE /api/memories` | `query` (1–1000), `type` (enum), `date` (YYYY-MM-DD regex) |
| `PUT /api/workspace/:key` | `content` (string, ≤100 KB), `key` checked against strict allowlist |
| `POST /api/git-info/workdir` | `sessionKey` (non-empty), `workdir` (non-empty, validated against allowed base) |

Validation errors return **HTTP 400** with the first Zod issue message as plain text or JSON.

---

## File Serving Security

The `GET /api/files` endpoint serves local image files with multiple layers of protection:

### 1. MIME Type Allowlist

Only image files are served:

| Extension | MIME Type |
|-----------|-----------|
| `.png` | `image/png` |
| `.jpg`, `.jpeg` | `image/jpeg` |
| `.gif` | `image/gif` |
| `.webp` | `image/webp` |
| `.svg` | `image/svg+xml` |
| `.avif` | `image/avif` |

Non-image file types return **403 Not an allowed file type**.

### 2. Directory Prefix Allowlist

Files are only served from these directories:

| Prefix | Source |
|--------|--------|
| `/tmp` | Hardcoded |
| `~/.openclaw` | Derived from `os.homedir()` |
| `MEMORY_DIR` | From configuration |

The request path is resolved to an absolute path via `path.resolve()`, blocking `..` traversal. The resolved path must start with one of the allowed prefixes (with a path separator check to prevent `/tmp-evil` matching `/tmp`).

### 3. Symlink Traversal Protection

After the prefix check passes, the file's **real path** is resolved via `fs.realpathSync()`. The real path is then re-checked against the same prefix allowlist. This prevents:

- Symlinks inside `/tmp` pointing to `/etc/passwd`
- Symlinks inside `~/.openclaw` pointing outside the allowed tree

If the real path falls outside allowed prefixes → **403 Access denied**.

### 4. Path Canonicalisation

The `~` prefix in input paths is expanded to `os.homedir()` before resolution, preventing home directory confusion.

---

## WebSocket Proxy Security

The WebSocket proxy (connecting the frontend to the OpenClaw gateway) restricts target hostnames:

**Default allowed hosts:** `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`

**Extend via** `WS_ALLOWED_HOSTS` env var (comma-separated):

```env
WS_ALLOWED_HOSTS=my-server.tailnet.ts.net,100.64.0.5
```

This prevents the proxy from being used to connect to arbitrary external hosts.

---

## Body Size Limits

| Scope | Limit | Enforced By |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Global (`/api/*`) | ~13 MB (12 MB + 1 MB overhead) | Hono `bodyLimit` middleware |
| TTS text | 5,000 characters | Zod schema |
| Transcription file | 12 MB | Application check |
| Agent log entry | 64 KB | Config constant |
| Workspace file write | 100 KB | Application check |
| Memory text | 10,000 characters | Zod schema |
| Memory section content | 50,000 characters | Zod schema |
| TTS config field | 2,000 characters | Application check |

Exceeding the global body limit returns **413 Request body too large**.

---

## Path Traversal Prevention

Multiple layers prevent directory traversal attacks:

| Route | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| `/api/files` | `path.resolve()` + prefix allowlist + symlink resolution + re-check |
| `/api/memories` (date params) | Regex validation: `/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/` — prevents injection in file paths |
| `/api/workspace/:key` | Strict key→filename allowlist (`soul`→`SOUL.md`, etc.) — no user-controlled paths |
| `/api/git-info/workdir` | Resolved path checked against allowed base directory (derived from git worktrees or `WORKSPACE_ROOT`). Exact match or child-path check with separator guard |

---

## TLS / HTTPS

Nerve automatically starts an HTTPS server alongside HTTP when certificates are present:

```
certs/cert.pem    # X.509 certificate
certs/key.pem     # RSA/EC private key
```

HSTS is always sent (`max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`), even over HTTP. Browsers that have previously visited over HTTPS will refuse HTTP connections for 1 year.

> **Microphone access** requires a [secure context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts). On `localhost` HTTP works, but network access requires HTTPS.

---

## Token & Secret Handling

| Secret | Storage | Exposure |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `GATEWAY_TOKEN` | `.env` file (chmod 600) | Only returned to loopback clients via `/api/connect-defaults`. Never logged. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `.env` file | Used server-side only. Never sent to clients. |
| `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` | `.env` file | Used server-side only. Never sent to clients. |
| Gateway token (client) | `sessionStorage` | Cleared when browser tab closes. Not persisted to disk. |

The setup wizard applies `chmod 600` to `.env` and backup files, restricting read access to the file owner.

---

## Client-Side Security

| Measure | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **DOMPurify** | All rendered HTML (agent messages, markdown) passes through DOMPurify with a strict tag/attribute allowlist |
| **Session storage** | Gateway token stored in `sessionStorage`, not `localStorage` — cleared on tab close |
| **CSP enforcement** | `script-src 'self' https://s3.tradingview.com` blocks inline scripts and limits external scripts to TradingView chart widgets only |
| **No eval** | No use of `eval()`, `Function()`, or `innerHTML` with unsanitised content |

---

## Configuration File Security

The setup wizard:

1. Writes `.env` atomically (via temp file + rename)
2. Applies `chmod 600` to `.env` and backup files
3. Cleans up `.env.tmp` on interruption (Ctrl+C handler)
4. Backs up existing `.env` before overwriting (timestamped `.env.bak.*`)

---
