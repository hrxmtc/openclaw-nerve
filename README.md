## What is Nerve?

You can already chat with your OpenClaw agent through webchat, Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord. Nerve is what you open when chatting isn't enough.

Nerve is a self-hosted cockpit for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) agents. Voice conversations, live workspace editing, inline charts, cron scheduling, and full token-level visibility. One install script. Running in 30 seconds.

## Why Nerve?

Messaging channels are great for chatting. But you can't watch charts render in real-time, edit your agent's workspace mid-conversation, browse its files, or monitor token spend from a Telegram window. Nerve gives you the full picture.

## What makes it different

### Voice that actually works
Talk to your agent. It talks back. Wake-word activation, local Whisper transcription (no API key needed), multi-provider TTS with Edge, OpenAI, and Replicate. Not a gimmick, a daily driver.

### Live charts from a chat message
Your agent can drop interactive TradingView charts, candlestick plots, and data visualizations directly into the conversation. Say "show me gold this year" and get a real chart, not a code block.

### Full workspace visibility
Your agent's memory, personality, tools, daily logs. All visible, all editable, all live. Change SOUL.md while it's mid-conversation. No restarts, no file hunting, no guessing what it remembers.

### Cron and scheduling from the UI
Create recurring jobs and one-shot reminders. Every scheduled run shows up as its own session in the sidebar. You can watch it execute live, read the full transcript, and see exactly what it did.

## Everything else

| | |
|---|---|
| **Streaming chat** | Markdown, syntax highlighting, diff views, image paste, file previews. All rendering as it streams |
| **File browser** | Browse your workspace, open files in tabs, edit with syntax highlighting. Real-time sync when your agent edits files |
| **Multi-session** | Session tree with sub-agents, per-session model overrides, unread indicators |
| **Sub-agents** | Spawn background workers with custom models and reasoning levels |
| **Monitoring** | Token usage, context window meter, cost tracking, activity logs |
| **Command palette** | Cmd+K to search, switch sessions, change models. Keyboard-first |
| **Search** | Full-text search across all messages in the current session |
| **14 themes** | Dark, light, and everything in between. Resizable panels, custom fonts |

## Get Started

### One command

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daggerhashimoto/openclaw-nerve/master/install.sh | bash
```

The installer handles dependencies, cloning, building, and launching. It runs a setup wizard that auto-detects your gateway token and walks you through configuration.

### Manual install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daggerhashimoto/openclaw-nerve.git
cd openclaw-nerve
npm install
npm run setup    # interactive wizard — configures .env
npm run prod     # builds and starts the server
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev            # frontend — Vite HMR on :3080
npm run dev:server     # backend — watch mode on :3081
```

**Requires:** Node.js 22+ and an [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) gateway.

## How it works

```
Browser ─── Nerve (:3080) ─── OpenClaw Gateway (:18789)
  │            │
  ├─ WS ──────┤  proxied to gateway
  ├─ SSE ─────┤  file watchers, real-time sync
  └─ REST ────┘  files, memories, TTS, models
```

Nerve proxies WebSocket traffic to your gateway and adds its own REST layer for voice, memory, and monitoring.

**Frontend:** React 19 · Tailwind CSS 4 · shadcn/ui · Vite 7
**Backend:** Hono 4 on Node.js
